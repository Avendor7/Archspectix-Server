# Archspectix Server

This is a basic proxy meant to pass on requests from the Arch repositories and the AUR. Sending it a search query returns the JSON. This still needs some work to normalize the data for any front end application to utilize it. 

## Running

Use NodeJS

`npm install`

`npm run start`

Should be live on port 3001
